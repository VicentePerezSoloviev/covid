# Covid-19 (death &amp; cases) evolution
When showing in the news the increasignly tendency of deaths and cases of the Covid-19, it shocks that some countries as EEUU or China have much more cases than other countries such as Italy or Spain. However, most of the graphics shown in the news, do not consider the amount of population of the country. 

In this project, I aim to show that considering the amount of population, the graphics van variate. Today (16/04/2020), EEUU does not appear as one of the most affected countries in my graphics. However, in the news is one of the most affected. 

In the HTML some figures shown the explained are exposed. The datasets used to do this analysis are every day updated, and can be consulted in https://vicenteperezsoloviev.github.io/covid/ . The figures to show the tendency among the countries, do consider the amount of population of each one. Different datasets are used. Can be consulted in the code. Also a breaf analysis of the spanish situation is done. 

Please, feel free to add more figures, or suggest changes.
